<p>The web is crawling with sites that shorten your URLs. However, if you want a site that makes&nbsp;an URL longer, you don't have much choice. Seems like people like to make urls shorter but don't care much for making them longer.</p>
<p>Here's one that shortens all your URLs&nbsp;using lower and upper case combinations of the letter X. <a href="http://github.com/punnie/xlongener">Here's the source code</a>.&nbsp;And to make the URL more interesting, it's live at&nbsp;<a href="http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx/" target="_blank">http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx/</a>.&nbsp;Suck it,&nbsp;<a href="http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx/xXxxXXxxxXXXxXxXXxXxXXxXXxXxXXXxXxXXxXXxxXxXXXXXxXXxxxxxXxxxxxXXxxXXXXxxxxxXxxXxXxXXxXxxxxXXXxXXXxXXXxxXxXXxxXxXxxXXXxXxXxxxXXXxXXXXxXXxXxXxxxXxxxXXxxXXXXxxxXxXXxXXxXXxxxXXXXxxxXXxXXXxXxXXXxxXXxxxxxXxxXXXxXxXXxxxxxxxxxxxxXXxXxxXXxxXXxxxXXXxxXxXxxXXXxxXxXxX">http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx/xXxxXXxxxXXXxXxXXxXxXXxXXxXxXXXxXxXXxXXxxXxXXXXXxXXxxxxxXxxxxxXXxxXXXXxxxxxXxxXxXxXXxXxxxxXXXxXXXxXXXxxXxXXxxXxXxxXXXxXxXxxxXXXxXXXXxXXxXxXxxxXxxxXXxxXXXXxxxXxXXxXXxXXxxxXXXXxxxXXxXXXxXxXXXxxXXxxxxxXxxXXXxXxXXxxxxxxxxxxxxXXxXxxXXxxXXxxxXXXxxXxXxxXXXxxXxXxX</a>.</p>
<p>Update: This domain will expire on May 15, 2014. The fee for renewal is triple what I payed to register the domain, so I'm letting it go. RIP xlongener&nbsp;;-(</p>
