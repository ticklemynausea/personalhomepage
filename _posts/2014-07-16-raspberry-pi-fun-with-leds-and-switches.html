<p>In the spirit of learning more about circuits and electronics I made a few experiments with my PI, a breadboard and a bunch of leds. Each led is directly controlled by a single GPIO pin.</p>
<p>This one is quite simple, as it cycles 5 leds on/off periodically.</p>

<p>This one cycles 7 leds on/off at the push of a tactile switch. I actually had to learn a bit more for this one, since switches must operate on a logic principle implemented by something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull-up_resistor">pull-up resistors</a>. These can be implemented with componentes on a physical circuit, but the PI's <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/cheat_sheet/">GPIO has a logical implementation</a>.</p>

<p>The next step would be to learn about multiplexing techniques as to lower the high requirement of GPIO pins (one per led). I'm yet to venture into that, though...<br />

jQuery(function() {<br />
    setTimeout(function() {<br />
          jQuery(".su-spoiler:nth-child(1) .su-spoiler-title").click();<br />
    });<br />
});<br />
</script></p>
