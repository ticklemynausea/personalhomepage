      Hi, My name is MÃ¡rio and I'm a Software Engineer

    %h2
      I've worked on full-stack web development for most of my career.

    %p
      I have developed and worked on simple websites with and without backends, as well as web applications with intricate user experience and complex backend architectures.
    %p
      My preferred stack is a <mark>Ruby on Rails</mark> backend with a <mark>React</mark> frontend. I prefer working with the <mark>PostgreSQL</mark> database.
    %p
      I've written code in many other languages.

      I like building infrastructure and systems.

    %p
      To support the websites and applications I have developed and worked on, I've used managed services, like <mark>Amazon Web Servies</mark> and <mark>Heroku</mark>. I have also managed my own services on bare hardware, having served applications and websites with my own installations of web servers and databases.
